# House Price Prediction Using ML
#Overview
House price prediction using machine learning involves collecting housing data, preprocessing it for cleaning and feature engineering, selecting a regression model like linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods, then training and evaluating the model's performance to predict house prices accurately.
# Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Tensorflow
3. Seaborn
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib
6. Jupyter Notebook (optional)
# To run the provided Python code step by step, follow these instructions:
# Install Required Libraries:
*Before running the code, ensure that you have installed the required libraries. You can install them using pip, if you haven't already:
# CMD Command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Prepare Data:
Prepare the house price prediction data by cleaning it to handle missing values and outliers, and then performing feature engineering to extract relevant features and encode categorical variables.
# Run the Code:
Run the house price prediction code by executing the main script or Jupyter Notebook cell to train the machine learning model and make predictions on new data.
# Execute the Code: 
*Run the code. This will execute each line of code sequentially.
